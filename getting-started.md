# Getting Started

Algorand is a permissionless, pure proof-of-stake blockchain that delivers decentralization, scalability, and security. Algorand can be used in many ways and this guide is intended to help you get set up and working with the blockchain as quickly as possible.

### Analytics for your Algorand Decentralized Applications

Flipside Crypto is currently providing free analytics for decentralized applications that run on the Algorand network. Using these analytics allows you to get critical performance data around your application quickly, including the number of unique addresses that interacting with your application, incoming and outgoing transactions, and incoming and outgoing Algos. All of these are also historically tracked so you can watch your application grow. To use this service [signup here](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/auth/signup). 

### Algorand Networks

Algorand currently has three networks: MainNet, TestNet, and DevNet. Our DevNet is intended to be used by developers who are working on the Algorand source code. Our TestNet is used by developers that want to be able to test an application before pushing it to the MainNet. TestNet also has a [Token dispenser](https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/) so you can fund specific accounts. If you are planning on developing an application on Algorand, it is recommended that you do so on TestNet. MainNet is Algorand's main network, used by production applications, and is the default installed network when running the installers. If you wish to install or switch networks, see [Switching Networks](/docs/switching-networks). 

### Algorand Source Code

Algorand is open source and the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand).

### **Installation**

See the [install](/docs/introduction-installing-node) instructions to get up and running on MainNet or TestNet.

### Core Concepts and Terminology
